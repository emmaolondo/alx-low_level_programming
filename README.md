0. strcat - This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
 strncat  - The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that

    it will use at most n bytes from src; and
    src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
